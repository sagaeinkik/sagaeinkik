## Recent school projects
As a newly graduated developer, my github repositories form a visual timeline of my learning journey, from the small school assignments that are my first introductions to a new technology, to the more comprehensive projects marking the end of each course.
There is always room for improvement, and I _love_ learning. Here are two of my favorite projects I've done recently.

### MBP Pattern Library – Final Project
MBP Pattern Library is a dual-sided digital solution for centralizing, managing, and integrating WordPress block pattern. The backend is built in Laravel with a MySQL database. The frontend is built with React using TypeScript and InertiaJS. The web application is synchronized with a custom built WordPress plugin.  
This project is built for the web bureau Mina Bästa Polare as an internal solution and is not published as of now.
  
_Tech stack: PHP, Laravel, React, TypeScript, InertiaJS, MySQL, WordPress_

### Summit – Fullstack development with frameworks
Summit is a comprehensive inventory management system for a fictional winter sports company. The backend was built with the NodeJS framework Fastify, using a MySQL database. The frontend was built using Vue, Tailwind CSS and SCSS.

## Current project
At the moment, I'm working on a pixel game. While I'm working on the graphics and figuring out animations, I am also building a website for presenting the game as well as organizing my work with a task manager.

Thank you for your time!
